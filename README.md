- 👋 Hi, I’m @GeodesicDragon
- 👀 I’m interested in making mods for RimWorld and addons for World of Warcraft; the latter can be found on CurseForge: https://www.curseforge.com/members/geodesicdragon/projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning XML and Lua
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment.
- 📫 You have a better chance of reaching me via my Discord server - https://discord.gg/BGKnpza - as I'm on Discord a lot, meaning I am far more likely to respond to any comments or requests for help there.
